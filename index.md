I am a PhD-student at University of Edinurgh. I am currently working on intelligent anomaly-detection methods for intrusion detection, and my areas of interest include deep learning, data science, as well as vulnerability and intrusion detection. 

<br />

My concern for our planet drives me to be an environmental activist with Greenpeace, where I coordinate and lead the local Greenpeace group in Edinburgh.

<br />

In my freetime, I like to challenge myself physically in sports such as boxing, sailing, or weight lifting. My passion is electronic music, where I attempt to find my own style. You can find me on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henry-clausen" target="_bank">SoundCloud</a>.
