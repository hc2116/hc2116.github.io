I am a PhD-graduate who is specialised in the application of data science and machine learning methods to cyber-security. I work as a data scientist for Cloudflare where I build API security systems. My background lies in data science, and during my PhD and subsequent research consultation project, I dealt with the challenges of intrusion detection and the corresponding data and developed efficient and adaptable problem-solving skills. 

<br />

My concern for our planet drives me to be an environmental activist with Greenpeace, where I coordinate and lead the local Greenpeace group in Edinburgh.

<br />

In my freetime, I like to challenge myself physically in sports such as Jiu-Jitsu, sailing, or running. My passion is electronic music, where I attempt to find my own style. You can find me on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/henry-clausen" target="_bank">SoundCloud</a>.
