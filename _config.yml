  bio:            I am a PhD-student at University of Edinburgh. I am currently working on intelligent anomaly-based intrusion detection methods, and my areas of interest include deep learning, data science, as well as vulnerability and intrusion detection. In my freetime, I like to challenge myself physically in sports such as  Jiu-Jitsu, sailing, or running. My passion is electronic music, where I attempt to find my own style.
