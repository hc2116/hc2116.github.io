### Activism
Since I was a young boy, I have been interested in nature, the intricate balance of ecosystems, and the effect that my actions have on it. 
Today, the state of our planet and the developments in our society towards environmental protection frighten me and driven me to be an environmental activist.

I am currently leading and coordinating the local Greenpeace group in Edinburgh, where campaign on issues such as climate change, ocean and forest protection, or biodiversity conservation.

### Music
Music is my passion, and I could not live without it. I enjoy playing piano, and even though I believe my technique stopped progressing years ago, I still find joy in learning to play pieces such as currently Claude Debussy's *Claire de Lune*.
